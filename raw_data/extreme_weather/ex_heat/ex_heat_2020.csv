Approximately ten minutes later, a homestead was heavily damaged about seven miles south-southwest of Memphis. At 1810 CST, a metal building, several more homesteads, and trees were damaged along Texas State Highway 86 west of Estelline. Microburst winds were estimated between 80 and 100 mph based on the damage indicators gathered during a NWS storm survey.||A second severe storm formed south-southwest of Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport around 1930 CST. This storm then tracked to the east-southeast developing severe wind gusts within the city of Lubbock. The winds toppled a brick wall of an old roofless structure, downed power poles, and caused considerable property damage at Joyland Amusement Park. In addition, a few people were injured by falling tree limbs at Joyland.||Additionally, the intense heat required a helicopter rescue of an individual from Caprock Canyons State Park in Briscoe County.

Multiple days of triple digit afternoon highs were recorded inland with some coastal locations even reaching the mid 90s. Several days of hot and dry weather further dried fuels over the area increasing fire danger. During this event, a surge of monsoonal and tropical moisture from a former Tropical Storm advected northward with sufficient instability to generate multiple high based and dry thunderstorms that produced several thousand lightning strikes over the Greater Bay Area. Many locations saw wind gusts of 40-50 mph with isolated areas seeing gusts of 60-75 mph. This prompted the San Francisco Bay Area forecast office to issue a rare severe thunderstorm warning. These lightning strikes in combination with gusty and erratic outflow winds sparked hundreds of wildfires across the state of California. Several smaller fires combined to form complexes some of which are now among the largest wildfires in state history. Most of which were still actively burning at the end of August. Hundreds of thousands of acres have been burned with several hundred structures destroyed as well as a handful of deaths and injuries. Tens of thousands of residents were also forced to evacuate.
