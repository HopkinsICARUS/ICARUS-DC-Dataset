High temperatures each day across the hotter deserts reached or exceeded 115 degrees and low temperatures did not fall off, remaining in the mid 80s to the low 90s each day. Phoenix Sky Harbor reached 116 on the 24th and the 25th, tying and setting records for the dates. The extreme heat led to the death of a man found in the open desert near Apache Junction on July 24th. During the afternoon hours on July 25th, the excessive heat resulted in heat-related illnesses to multiple students at Gilbert High School including a teen who fell ill during afternoon football practice. An Excessive Heat Warning was in effect for all of the lower deserts of south central and southwest Arizona during the 3 day period.","Very strong high pressure aloft developed across the lower deserts of Arizona from July 23rd through July 25th which resulted in excessive heat across the lower deserts. The hotter lower deserts reached or exceeded 115 degrees each day during the 3 day period; Phoenix reached 116 degrees on both the 24th and 25th and both of these marks tied or broke daily records. Low temperatures remained in the upper 80s to low 90s each morning resulting in very dangerous conditions especially for those spending time outdoors during the heat of the day. The presence of excessive heat was confirmed via locally derived heat risk data. According to a report from local broadcast media, at 1738MST on July 25th a teen was taken to a hospital after suffering a heat-related illness during football practice at Gilbert High School, about 4 miles southwest of the town of Higley.
