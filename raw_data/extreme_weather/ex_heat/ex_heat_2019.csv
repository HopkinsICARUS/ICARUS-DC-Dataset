Despite high temperatures only reaching to near seasonal normals (and falling well short of excessive heat warning thresholds) it proved hot enough to be fatal to an elderly man whose car became stuck in desert sand stranding him without water or shade. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office indicated that their helicopter spotted the man's vehicle stranded in sand on Gila River Indian land near Sun Lakes. Authorities found his body at 1340MST on Thursday June 6th; he was deceased. The sheriff's office indicated that the death was likely due to heat exposure.,"During the first week of June high temperatures over the deserts were near to slightly below seasonal normal, but did finally reach into the triple digits by Wednesday June 5th. Despite highs being near normal (and well below excessive heat warning thresholds) they were sufficient to lead to a fatality in the deserts to the south of Phoenix. According to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, their helicopter spotted the vehicle of a World War 2 veteran stuck in soft sand on Gila River Indian land south of Phoenix at 1340MST Thursday June 6th. The 97 year old veteran had died due to exposure and dehydration. He had been missing for several days before being discovered on Thursday.",CSV

The heat was the result of persistent atmospheric high pressure centered over central Texas, with low level southerly flow providing enhanced tropical moisture via exceptional dew point temperatures, even during the afternoon. The period of excessive heat was from June 17 through 24, so more fatalities may have occurred in the Rio Grande Valley during this time.","A New York Times article described potential heat-related deaths, as provided by United States Border Patrol (USBP), during the afternoon of June 23, 2019, in the brush inside the levee along the Rio Grande south of McAllen. One woman (age unknown but assumed to be in her 20s) and three children (two infants and a toddler) were pronounced dead when found that evening. Between 3 and 4 PM CDT, the heat index at McAllen/Miller Airport, less than 10 miles north of the location of the bodies and the most relevant proxy location, reported more than an hour of heat index of 118 degrees.

From Marion southward to Metropolis and Cairo, the heat index peaked at or just above 110 degrees. Elsewhere across southern Illinois, the peak heat index was from 105 to 109. Actual air temperatures reached the lower 90's from Marion southward, and generally around 90 elsewhere. Dew points were in the upper 70's to near 80, which resulted in the very high heat indices. At mid levels of the atmosphere, a large ridge of high pressure dominated the southern half of the United States. A weak surface warm front over the lower Ohio Valley caused dew points to pool into the upper 70's to near 80.",,CSV
