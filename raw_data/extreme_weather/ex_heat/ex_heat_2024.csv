Two troughs ejected out into the north-central CONUS during this episode. The first brought two back to back nights of severe weather across portions of northeast Nebraska the night of the 28th and the 29th. The second trough moved out into the central Plains and brought the synoptic scale forcing for a historic severe wind event that impacted both Lincoln and Omaha metropolitan areas. Wind gusts as high as 100 miles per hour extended from Lancaster County northeast to the Nebraska-Iowa border, leaving behind a large swath of significant tree, powerline and structural damage. Power outages from this storm lasted for up to a week in some locations, particularly in Omaha. ||This episode also featured several afternoons of excessive heat for portions of southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa. A few instances of 110 degree heat indices were observed in a few southwest Iowa counties the afternoon of the 29th, with even more widespread excessive heat the afternoon of the 31st across much of the forecast area south of Interstate 80. Peak heat indices in this region topped out between 110 and 115 degrees before afternoon convection cooled temperatures back down.","A combination of hot afternoon temperatures and high dew points brought a brief period of excessive heat during the afternoon, with heat indices up to 110 being observed in a few counties across southwest Iowa. The Clarinda AWOS station had artificially high heat indices, but was still likely meeting excessive heat criteria given its proximity to the Shenandoah AWOs station. As such, to be consistent with surrounding areas, heat indices up to 110 were still likely observed.",CSV

Power outages from this storm lasted for up to a week in some locations, particularly in Omaha.||This episode also featured several afternoons of excessive heat for portions of southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa. A few instances of 110 degree heat indices were observed in a few southwest Iowa counties the afternoon of the 29th, with even more widespread excessive heat the afternoon of the 31st across much of the forecast area south of Interstate 80. Peak heat indices in this region topped out between 110 and 115 degrees before afternoon convection cooled temperatures back down.","A combination of hot temperatures and high dew points brought excessive heat during the afternoon hour for portions of the county. Though no official observations came from the county, its proximity to other counties with observed excessive heat indices supports the likelihood that the same conditions were present here. Peak heat indices likely reached  about 111 degrees.",CSV

The second trough moved out into the central Plains and brought the synoptic scale forcing for a historic severe wind event that impacted both Lincoln and Omaha metropolitan areas. Wind gusts as high as 100 miles per hour extended from Lancaster County northeast to the Nebraska-Iowa border, leaving behind a large swath of significant tree, powerline and structural damage. Power outages from this storm lasted for up to a week in some locations, particularly in Omaha. ||This episode also featured several afternoons of excessive heat for portions of southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa. A few instances of 110 degree heat indices were observed in a few southwest Iowa counties the afternoon of the 29th, with even more widespread excessive heat the afternoon of the 31st across much of the forecast area south of Interstate 80.

The second trough moved out into the central Plains and brought the synoptic scale forcing for a historic severe wind event that impacted both Lincoln and Omaha metropolitan areas.

On the 21st, a stationary front was draped across northeast Nebraska into Iowa. Ahead of one of the aforementioned shortwave troughs, several rounds of strong thunderstorms developed near this frontal zone and moved across northeast Nebraska. At 8 pm on the 21st, radar imagery showed training thunderstorms had set up across central Nebraska. These storms moved into east-central Nebraska dropping 2 to 6 inches of rain across the Platte River Basin. As a result, minor flooding was observed along the Platte River in Dodge, Saunders, Douglas and Sarpy Counties. Further north in Knox County, additional rounds of thunderstorms brought flooding to the Ponca Creek, prompting emergency management to deploy sand bags. Flooding in these locations continued for several days before subsiding the 23rd.||Behind this first shortwave, a shortwave ridge moved out into the central Plains accompanied by a surface high pressure system. Afternoon high temperatures in the 90s and dew points in the mid and upper 70s brought excessive heat to much of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa the afternoons of the 24th and the 25th. Excessive heat was most widespread on the 24th, with heat indices across the entire WFO ranging from 107 to 120 degrees. Afternoon thunderstorms on the 25th mitigated excessive heat, though heat indices did hit 110 in far southwest Iowa.||On the 25th, another shortwave trough brought more unsettled weather to the region. A surface front was draped across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa when the first convection initiated over downtown Omaha. This storm quickly became intense, producing multiple instances of 3 to 4 inch hail in the Omaha metro. As this storm weakened over eastern Sarpy County, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed across northeast Nebraska. While the most widespread hazard was large hail up to the size of golf balls, two tornadoes were confirmed in Madison County. Later that evening, a bow echo developed and moved through the northern Omaha Metro, bringing wind gusts up to 90 miles per hour at Eppley Airfield and into northern Pottawattamie County. An additional line of storms developed after dark that night across southeast Nebraska and produced scattered damaging wind gusts, the highest of which was an 83 mph wind gust measured by emergency management in Jefferson County.||The unsettled weather at the end of June brought widespread excessive rain to much of southeast South Dakota and Northwest Iowa. Rainfall estimated from these storms showed a swath of 4 to 8 inches of rain that fell between Sioux Falls and Sioux City. The result of this rain and additional rain across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa was river flooding along the Missouri and Little Sioux the last week of June and into July. Flooding during this time frame resulted in numerous road closures, including I-29 between Council Bluffs and Missouri Valley. This stretch of the interstate was closed beginning midnight the night of the 25th, and remained closed through the end of the month. Levee breaches in Monona County on the 25th prompted several evacuations, as resultant flash flooding inundated multiple county roads and homesteads.

On the 21st, a stationary front was draped across northeast Nebraska into Iowa. Ahead of one of the aforementioned shortwave troughs, several rounds of strong thunderstorms developed near this frontal zone and moved across northeast Nebraska. At 8 pm on the 21st, radar imagery showed training thunderstorms had set up across central Nebraska. These storms moved into east-central Nebraska dropping 2 to 6 inches of rain across the Platte River Basin. As a result, minor flooding was observed along the Platte River in Dodge, Saunders, Douglas and Sarpy Counties. Further north in Knox County, additional rounds of thunderstorms brought flooding to the Ponca Creek, prompting emergency management to deploy sand bags. Flooding in these locations continued for several days before subsiding the 23rd.||Behind this first shortwave, a shortwave ridge moved out into the central Plains accompanied by a surface high pressure system. Afternoon high temperatures in the 90s and dew points in the mid and upper 70s brought excessive heat to much of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa the afternoons of the 24th and the 25th. Excessive heat was most widespread on the 24th, with heat indices across the entire WFO ranging from 107 to 120 degrees. Afternoon thunderstorms on the 25th mitigated excessive heat, though heat indices did hit 110 in far southwest Iowa.||On the 25th, another shortwave trough brought more unsettled weather to the region. A surface front was draped across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa when the first convection initiated over downtown Omaha. This storm quickly became intense, producing multiple instances of 3 to 4 inch hail in the Omaha metro. As this storm weakened over eastern Sarpy County, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed across northeast Nebraska. While the most widespread hazard was large hail up to the size of golf balls, two tornadoes were confirmed in Madison County. Later that evening, a bow echo developed and moved through the northern Omaha Metro, bringing wind gusts up to 90 miles per hour at Eppley Airfield and into northern Pottawattamie County. An additional line of storms developed after dark that night across southeast Nebraska and produced scattered damaging wind gusts, the highest of which was an 83 mph wind gust measured by emergency management in Jefferson County.||The unsettled weather at the end of June brought widespread excessive rain to much of southeast South Dakota and Northwest Iowa. Rainfall estimated from these storms showed a swath of 4 to 8 inches of rain that fell between Sioux Falls and Sioux City. The result of this rain and additional rain across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa was river flooding along the Missouri and Little Sioux the last week of June and into July. Flooding during this time frame resulted in numerous road closures, including I-29 between Council Bluffs and Missouri Valley. This stretch of the interstate was closed beginning midnight the night of the 25th, and remained closed through the end of the month. Levee breaches in Monona County on the 25th prompted several evacuations, as resultant flash flooding inundated multiple county roads and homesteads.

A surface front was draped across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa when the first convection initiated over downtown Omaha. This storm quickly became intense, producing multiple instances of 3 to 4 inch hail in the Omaha metro. As this storm weakened over eastern Sarpy County, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed across northeast Nebraska. While the most widespread hazard was large hail up to the size of golf balls, two tornadoes were confirmed in Madison County. Later that evening, a bow echo developed and moved through the northern Omaha Metro, bringing wind gusts up to 90 miles per hour at Eppley Airfield and into northern Pottawattamie County. An additional line of storms developed after dark that night across southeast Nebraska and produced scattered damaging wind gusts, the highest of which was an 83 mph wind gust measured by emergency management in Jefferson County.||The unsettled weather at the end of June brought widespread excessive rain to much of southeast South Dakota and Northwest Iowa. Rainfall estimated from these storms showed a swath of 4 to 8 inches of rain that fell between Sioux Falls and Sioux City. The result of this rain and additional rain across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa was river flooding along the Missouri and Little Sioux the last week of June and into July. Flooding during this time frame resulted in numerous road closures, including I-29 between Council Bluffs and Missouri Valley. This stretch of the interstate was closed beginning midnight the night of the 25th, and remained closed through the end of the month. Levee breaches in Monona County on the 25th prompted several evacuations, as resultant flash flooding inundated multiple county roads and homesteads. No injuries or fatalities were reported from this. While flooding subsided in and north of the Omaha metro by the end of the month, river flooding along the Missouri persisted into the first week of July.",A max heat index of 116 was observed at the Shenandoah Municipal Airport (AWOS).,CSV

On the 21st, a stationary front was draped across northeast Nebraska into Iowa. Ahead of one of the aforementioned shortwave troughs, several rounds of strong thunderstorms developed near this frontal zone and moved across northeast Nebraska. At 8 pm on the 21st, radar imagery showed training thunderstorms had set up across central Nebraska. These storms moved into east-central Nebraska dropping 2 to 6 inches of rain across the Platte River Basin. As a result, minor flooding was observed along the Platte River in Dodge, Saunders, Douglas and Sarpy Counties. Further north in Knox County, additional rounds of thunderstorms brought flooding to the Ponca Creek, prompting emergency management to deploy sand bags. Flooding in these locations continued for several days before subsiding the 23rd.||Behind this first shortwave, a shortwave ridge moved out into the central Plains accompanied by a surface high pressure system. Afternoon high temperatures in the 90s and dew points in the mid and upper 70s brought excessive heat to much of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa the afternoons of the 24th and the 25th. Excessive heat was most widespread on the 24th, with heat indices across the entire WFO ranging from 107 to 120 degrees. Afternoon thunderstorms on the 25th mitigated excessive heat, though heat indices did hit 110 in far southwest Iowa.||On the 25th, another shortwave trough brought more unsettled weather to the region. A surface front was draped across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa when the first convection initiated over downtown Omaha. This storm quickly became intense, producing multiple instances of 3 to 4 inch hail in the Omaha metro. As this storm weakened over eastern Sarpy County, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed across northeast Nebraska. While the most widespread hazard was large hail up to the size of golf balls, two tornadoes were confirmed in Madison County. Later that evening, a bow echo developed and moved through the northern Omaha Metro, bringing wind gusts up to 90 miles per hour at Eppley Airfield and into northern Pottawattamie County. An additional line of storms developed after dark that night across southeast Nebraska and produced scattered damaging wind gusts, the highest of which was an 83 mph wind gust measured by emergency management in Jefferson County.||The unsettled weather at the end of June brought widespread excessive rain to much of southeast South Dakota and Northwest Iowa. Rainfall estimated from these storms showed a swath of 4 to 8 inches of rain that fell between Sioux Falls and Sioux City. The result of this rain and additional rain across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa was river flooding along the Missouri and Little Sioux the last week of June and into July. Flooding during this time frame resulted in numerous road closures, including I-29 between Council Bluffs and Missouri Valley. This stretch of the interstate was closed beginning midnight the night of the 25th, and remained closed through the end of the month. Levee breaches in Monona County on the 25th prompted several evacuations, as resultant flash flooding inundated multiple county roads and homesteads.

Afternoon high temperatures in the 90s and dew points in the mid and upper 70s brought excessive heat to much of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa the afternoons of the 24th and the 25th. Excessive heat was most widespread on the 24th, with heat indices across the entire WFO ranging from 107 to 120 degrees. Afternoon thunderstorms on the 25th mitigated excessive heat, though heat indices did hit 110 in far southwest Iowa.||On the 25th, another shortwave trough brought more unsettled weather to the region. A surface front was draped across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa when the first convection initiated over downtown Omaha. This storm quickly became intense, producing multiple instances of 3 to 4 inch hail in the Omaha metro. As this storm weakened over eastern Sarpy County, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed across northeast Nebraska. While the most widespread hazard was large hail up to the size of golf balls, two tornadoes were confirmed in Madison County. Later that evening, a bow echo developed and moved through the northern Omaha Metro, bringing wind gusts up to 90 miles per hour at Eppley Airfield and into northern Pottawattamie County. An additional line of storms developed after dark that night across southeast Nebraska and produced scattered damaging wind gusts, the highest of which was an 83 mph wind gust measured by emergency management in Jefferson County.||The unsettled weather at the end of June brought widespread excessive rain to much of southeast South Dakota and Northwest Iowa. Rainfall estimated from these storms showed a swath of 4 to 8 inches of rain that fell between Sioux Falls and Sioux City. The result of this rain and additional rain across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa was river flooding along the Missouri and Little Sioux the last week of June and into July. Flooding during this time frame resulted in numerous road closures, including I-29 between Council Bluffs and Missouri Valley. This stretch of the interstate was closed beginning midnight the night of the 25th, and remained closed through the end of the month. Levee breaches in Monona County on the 25th prompted several evacuations, as resultant flash flooding inundated multiple county roads and homesteads. No injuries or fatalities were reported from this. While flooding subsided in and north of the Omaha metro by the end of the month, river flooding along the Missouri persisted into the first week of July.",A max heat index of 119 was observed at the Harlan AWOS.,CSV

On the 21st, a stationary front was draped across northeast Nebraska into Iowa. Ahead of one of the aforementioned shortwave troughs, several rounds of strong thunderstorms developed near this frontal zone and moved across northeast Nebraska. At 8 pm on the 21st, radar imagery showed training thunderstorms had set up across central Nebraska. These storms moved into east-central Nebraska dropping 2 to 6 inches of rain across the Platte River Basin. As a result, minor flooding was observed along the Platte River in Dodge, Saunders, Douglas and Sarpy Counties.

The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services reported 80 heat related hospitalizations across the state during this period of excessive heat. While many of the 19 counties reporting these cases masked the exact number of hospitalizations in order to protect personal health information, it was released that there were 37 heat related hospitalizations in Douglas County, 13 in Lancaster County, and 7 in Sarpy County. The vast majority of these heat related illnesses (66.25%) occurred at work or while participating in outdoor recreation. 12.5% were among the homeless population, and 8.75% of heat related hospitalizations were due to a lack of air conditioning. Furthermore, the age group most impacted by heat related illness for this event were between the ages of 20 and 29, accounting for 30% of heat related hospitalizations in the state.||On the 25th, another shortwave trough brought more unsettled weather to the region.

On the 21st, a stationary front was draped across northeast Nebraska into Iowa. Ahead of one of the aforementioned shortwave troughs, several rounds of strong thunderstorms developed near this frontal zone and moved across northeast Nebraska. At 8 pm on the 21st, radar imagery showed training thunderstorms had set up across central Nebraska. These storms moved into east-central Nebraska dropping 2 to 6 inches of rain across the Platte River Basin. As a result, minor flooding was observed along the Platte River in Dodge, Saunders, Douglas and Sarpy Counties. Further north in Knox County, additional rounds of thunderstorms brought flooding to the Ponca Creek, prompting emergency management to deploy sand bags. Flooding in these locations continued for several days before subsiding the 23rd.||Behind this first shortwave, a shortwave ridge moved out into the central Plains accompanied by a surface high pressure system. Afternoon high temperatures in the 90s and dew points in the mid and upper 70s brought excessive heat to much of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa the afternoons of the 24th and the 25th. Excessive heat was most widespread on the 24th, with heat indices across the entire WFO ranging from 107 to 120 degrees. Afternoon thunderstorms on the 25th mitigated excessive heat, though heat indices did hit 110 in far southwest Iowa. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services reported 80 heat related hospitalizations across the state during this period of excessive heat. While many of the 19 counties reporting these cases masked the exact number of hospitalizations in order to protect personal health information, it was released that there were 37 heat related hospitalizations in Douglas County, 13 in Lancaster County, and 7 in Sarpy County. The vast majority of these heat related illnesses (66.25%) occurred at work or while participating in outdoor recreation. 12.5% were among the homeless population, and 8.75% of heat related hospitalizations were due to a lack of air conditioning. Furthermore, the age group most impacted by heat related illness for this event were between the ages of 20 and 29, accounting for 30% of heat related hospitalizations in the state.||On the 25th, another shortwave trough brought more unsettled weather to the region. A surface front was draped across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa when the first convection initiated over downtown Omaha. This storm quickly became intense producing multiple instances of 3 to 4 inch hail in the Omaha metro. As this storm weakened over eastern Sarpy County, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed across northeast Nebraska. While the most widespread hazard was large hail up to the size of golf balls, two tornadoes were confirmed in Madison County. Later that evening, a bow echo developed and moved through the northern Omaha Metro, bringing wind gusts up to 90 miles per hour at Eppley Airfield and into northern Pottawattamie County. An additional line of storms developed after dark that night across southeast Nebraska and produced scattered damaging wind gusts, the highest of which was an 83 mph wind gust measured by emergency management in Jefferson County.||The unsettled weather at the end of June brought widespread excessive rain to much of southeast South Dakota and Northwest Iowa. Rainfall estimated from these storms showed a swath of 4 to 8 inches of rain that fell between Sioux Falls and Sioux City. The result of this rain and additional rain across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa was river flooding along the Missouri and Little Sioux the last week of June and into July. Flooding during this time frame resulted in numerous road closures, including I-29 between Council Bluffs and Missouri Valley. This stretch of the interstate was closed beginning midnight the night of the 25th, and remained closed through the end of the month. Levee breaches in Monona County on the 25th prompted several evacuations, as resultant flash flooding inundated multiple county roads and homesteads. No injuries or fatalities were reported from this. While flooding subsided in and north of the Omaha metro by the end of the month, river flooding along the Missouri persisted into the first week of July.",A max heat index of 110 was observed at the Millard AWOS.

Ahead of one of the aforementioned shortwave troughs, several rounds of strong thunderstorms developed near this frontal zone and moved across northeast Nebraska. At 8 pm on the 21st, radar imagery showed training thunderstorms had set up across central Nebraska. These storms moved into east-central Nebraska dropping 2 to 6 inches of rain across the Platte River Basin. As a result, minor flooding was observed along the Platte River in Dodge, Saunders, Douglas and Sarpy Counties. Further north in Knox County, additional rounds of thunderstorms brought flooding to the Ponca Creek, prompting emergency management to deploy sand bags. Flooding in these locations continued for several days before subsiding the 23rd.||Behind this first shortwave, a shortwave ridge moved out into the central Plains accompanied by a surface high pressure system. Afternoon high temperatures in the 90s and dew points in the mid and upper 70s brought excessive heat to much of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa the afternoons of the 24th and the 25th.

While many of the 19 counties reporting these cases masked the exact number of hospitalizations in order to protect personal health information, it was released that there were 37 heat related hospitalizations in Douglas County, 13 in Lancaster County, and 7 in Sarpy County. The vast majority of these heat related illnesses (66.25%) occurred at work or while participating in outdoor recreation. 12.5% were among the homeless population, and 8.75% of heat related hospitalizations were due to a lack of air conditioning. Furthermore, the age group most impacted by heat related illness for this event were between the ages of 20 and 29, accounting for 30% of heat related hospitalizations in the state.||On the 25th, another shortwave trough brought more unsettled weather to the region.

As this storm weakened over eastern Sarpy County, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed across northeast Nebraska.

Widespread severe weather occurred along this line. Widespread and, in some areas, considerable wind damage was observed along with embedded tornadoes through the western and southern Adirondacks, Mohawk Valley, Upper Hudson Valley and Capital District with the most intense storms occurring along and north of Interstate 90. Observed wind gusts ranged between 50 and 87 mph with these storms with the latter wind gust reported at the New York State Mesonet at Glens Falls.||National Weather Service Storm Surveys, with some being assisted by other state authorities, concluded seven tornado touchdowns. Six of these tornadoes were rated EF-1 with estimated peak winds between 90 and 110 mph. These tornadoes occurred in the Town of Ohio (Herkimer County), Little Moose Lake/Limekiln Lake (Hamilton County), the West Branch of the Sacandaga River/West River Road (Hamilton County), Oxbow Lake (Hamilton County), Wilcox Lake Wild Forest (Hamilton/Warren County), and the Town of Day (Saratoga County). One EF-0 tornado touched down near The Glen in central Warren County with estimated peak winds of 85 mph. During clean up efforts from the Town of Day tornado, a woman was seriously injured (indirect) after being struck by a tree.||In addition to tornadoes, two microbursts, determined through remote damage assessment using drone footage and satellite imagery, were noted in Warren County. Both brought large areas of extensive tree damage with hundreds of hardwood trees being uprooted and snapped. The first was noted in western Warren County along and east of Stewart Creek with the second around Bear Point at the Tongue Mountain Range that extends into Lake George. ||These thunderstorms resulted in numerous to widespread power outages with Hamilton and Warren counties the hardest hit. Some power outages lasted for multiple days and some area roads were also impassable for days.||States of Emergency were declared for multiple municipalities including the City of Glens Falls and all of Warren and Saratoga counties. New York Governor Kathy Hochul also declared a state of emergency for all of New York State following all of the severe thunderstorms that impacted the state over the past week.||The governor requested a Federal Emergency Declaration following this severe weather event which included the counties of Hamilton, Herkimer, Montgomery, Saratoga and Warren counties.||Scattered thunderstorms gradually developed across the mid-Hudson Valley eastward across the central and southern Taconics producing some additional pockets of wind damage, but this activity was much less widespread and intense compared to the storms farther north.",,CSV
